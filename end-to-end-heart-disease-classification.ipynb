    "# Predicting heart disease using machine learning\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook looks into using various Python-based machine learning and data science libraries in an attempt to build a machine learning model capable of predict whether or not someone has heart disease based on their medical attributes.\n",

    "## 1. Problem definition\n",
    "\n",
    "In a statement, \n",
    "> Given clinical parameters about a patient, can we predict wether a pacient have heart disease?\n",

    "## 2. Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The original data came from the Cleveland data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.\n",

    "\n",
    "> If we can reach 95% accuracy at predicting whether or not a patient has heart disease during the proof of concept, we'll pursue the project.\n",
